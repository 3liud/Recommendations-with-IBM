# Recommendations-with-IBM
This recommendation engine project focuses on recommending articles to readers based on different recommendation system approaches such as <b>Knowledge based recommendation, Rank Based recommendations, user-user based recommendation and matrix factorization</b> each fo the methods discussed and applied focus on addressing a weakness that exists in the other method. finally, conclusion made is that the best method to use to address all recommendation needs such as the cold start problem would be to use a hybrid approach that incorporates more than one recommendation approach.
